# Media Encryption Using Cryptography and Steganography

## Overview

The **Media Encryption Using Cryptography and Steganography** project focuses on securing digital information through **data encryption and covert data hiding techniques**. By combining **cryptographic algorithms** with **steganographic methods**, the system ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and resistance to unauthorized access or tampering during transmission.

This project demonstrates practical expertise in **information security, multimedia processing, and secure application development**, making it well-suited for **cybersecurity, software engineering, and data security portfolios**.

## Objectives

- Secure sensitive data against unauthorized access  
- Prevent data tampering during transmission  
- Conceal encrypted information within multimedia files  
- Provide a user-friendly interface for secure media encryption  

---

## Project Description

The project implements a dual-layer security approach:

- **Cryptography** encrypts the original data, transforming it into unreadable ciphertext.
- **Steganography** embeds the encrypted data within media files (images, audio, or video) without perceptible distortion.

Users can select the media type and encryption algorithm through a web-based interface. The encrypted data is then embedded into the chosen media, ensuring both secrecy and stealth during transmission.

## Key Concepts

### Cryptography

Cryptography secures data through encryption and decryption techniques. Only authorized users with the correct key can decrypt and access the original information, ensuring **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication**.

### Steganography

Steganography conceals information within digital media in a way that is imperceptible to human senses. Unlike cryptography, which hides the content, steganography hides the **existence** of the data itself.
