# Media-Encryption-using-cryptography-and-Steganography
Data hiding is an important task that has to be taken into account to maintain the integrity and 
security of the information to be transmitted in addition to avoid the tampering of the data. An 
adversary is not just modifying someone else’s data but to use for one’s own benefits. Data hiding task 
is performed to protect it from a third-party user who may misuse the information. Certain approaches 
aim to successfully implement the security method of data hiding to secure and protect the data to be 
transmitted. Cryptography and Steganography are two of the three methods of data hiding.
This project provides a method to perform data hiding using various algorithms based on the 
user’s discretion for any form of media: Audio, Image or Video. A plethora of algorithms are 
implemented together in the web application for the user’s preference/choice while encrypting media.
