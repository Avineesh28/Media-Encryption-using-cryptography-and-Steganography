**Media Encryption using Cryptography and Steganography**

Welcome to the Media Encryption project repository! This project focuses on data hiding, a crucial aspect to ensure the integrity and security of transmitted information, preventing unauthorized access and tampering. Data hiding becomes imperative to protect data from misuse and unauthorized modifications.

### Project Overview

Data hiding involves methods like Cryptography and Steganography. Cryptography ensures secure communication through encryption techniques, making data unreadable without the correct decryption key. Steganography, on the other hand, conceals information within media files, making it imperceptible to the human eye or ear.

This project provides a comprehensive solution for data hiding in various forms of media: Audio, Image, or Video. Users can choose from a range of algorithms implemented in the web application to encrypt media according to their preferences. The encrypted data is then embedded within the chosen media, ensuring confidentiality and security during transmission.

### What is Steganography?

**Steganography** is the art and science of concealing information within media files without altering their perceptible features. It hides the existence of data within seemingly innocuous files, making it difficult to detect. Steganographic techniques vary, from hiding text within images to embedding audio in video files, ensuring covert data transmission.

### What is Cryptography?

**Cryptography** involves securing communication and data through encryption and decryption techniques. It transforms plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext, which can be decrypted back to its original form only by authorized parties possessing the correct key. Cryptography plays a pivotal role in ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
